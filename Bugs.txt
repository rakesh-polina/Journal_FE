TEJA :

1.
Excalendar UI adjustments. 
I am not able to minimize it when there are more than 5 events on the page
Need to bring it out of scroll view and adjust some styles


2.
Splashscreen doesnt look good 


3.
Reloading the whole application should not happen while loggin out


4.
Back navigation should be completely removed in some cases 
ex:(Should not be possible to go to login from home)


5.
Something wrong with upload files while updating a event previous uploads are trashed at times. 


6.
email -> personal details -> {...}
      -> date -> events
 backend structure for storing data


7. 
email validations while creating account


8.
new controller needs to be defined for updating files. 


9.
create event and upload files are different api's; 
resulting in success call for one ends up creating event but failure to upload files still persists
